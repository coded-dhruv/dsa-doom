# ⚔️ DSA DOOM - My 100-Day DSA Challenge

This is my daily DSA practice repo based on the [Complete DSA Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe137I_EPQd34TsgV6IO55pt&si=d81dLE6OKbKPLlmX) by **Shradha Khapra (Apna College)**.

The goal is simple:  
✅ Learn DSA from scratch  
✅ Solve problems consistently  
✅ Push code every day to turn my GitHub green 💚  
✅ Build solid DSA foundations for coding interviews and CP
